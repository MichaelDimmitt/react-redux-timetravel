# React Redux with Time travel sample

This is a sample app using Redux and React. It is created as an example on how to the [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) work and how you can integrate them into your app to speed up development.

If you are interested in hybrid app development using React, check out the [Onsen UI React Components](https://onsen.io/v2/react.html). We would love to get your feedback. We love getting stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI).

For a more complete example using React and Redux with Onsen UI, please check out the [Weather app](http://argelius.github.io/react-onsenui-redux-weather/demo.html). Source code [here](https://github.com/argelius/react-onsenui-redux-weather).
